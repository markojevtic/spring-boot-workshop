## Which architectural style is right for you team: monolith or microservices

Nowadays microservices architecture(MSA in further text) is very popular, everyone talks about it and want to implement it in own application. 
I like MSA and they are great because of many reasons, I'm going to talk about it later. But many people are misled about MSA, and because of 
that please keep in mind following things:
* MSA ≠ silver bullet 
* monolith ≠ bad architecture

If your application is a monolith it does not mean that it has bad architecture, or if it is a MSA application it does not mean that it has
good architecture. What is exactly good or bad architecture? To clarify that, let's first define what architecture is. I like the following definition:
> Architecture definition...
> Clean architecture, Uncle Bob

Let's define, what is good architecture, application with good architecture must be:
1) easy to developing
2) easy to deploying
3) easy to maintenance
4) adding new feature must be easy
To satisfy those for criteria of good architecture is not enough just to chose
an architectural style monolith or microservices. Therefore choosing MSA or monolith is not question
of good or bad architecture. In consideration which one to use we should take many things: 
benefits of style, project needs, team, project budget, etc.

### MSA benefits
- developing process(many teams, polyglot, multiple dbs)
- deploying ( canary release, multiple application, etc..)
- maintenance ( zero downtime)
- adding new feature ( )
